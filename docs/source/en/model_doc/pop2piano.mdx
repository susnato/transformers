# Pop2Piano

## Overview

The Pop2Piano model was proposed in [Pop2Piano : Pop Audio-based Piano Cover Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00895) by Jongho Choi, Kyogu Lee.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The piano cover of pop music is widely enjoyed by people. How-ever,
the generation task of the pop piano cover is still understudied.
This is partly due to the lack of synchronized {Pop, Piano
Cover} data pairs, which made it challenging to apply the latest
data-intensive deep learning-based methods. To leverage the power
of the data-driven approach, we make a large amount of paired and
synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data using an automated
pipeline. In this paper, we present Pop2Piano, a Transformer net-
work that generates piano covers given waveforms of pop music. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to directly generate
a piano cover from pop audio without melody and chord extraction
modules. We show that Pop2Piano trained with our dataset can
generate plausible piano covers.*
